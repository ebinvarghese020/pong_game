# pong_game

A classic arcade game built using Python classes and the Turtle module, where two players can compete against each other. The objective is to hit the ball past the opponent's 
paddle and score points. The game provides an engaging and interactive experience, allowing players to test their reflexes and compete for high scores.

## Features
'**Two-Player Mode**': Enjoy a head-to-head competition with a friend, where each player controls their own paddle using arrow keys (Player 1) and W/S keys (Player 2).
'**Realistic Gameplay**': Experience smooth and responsive ball movement, paddle collisions, and realistic physics, providing an authentic gaming experience.
'**Score Tracking**': Keep track of each player's score throughout the game and display it on the screen. The scores are updated dynamically as the game progresses.


## How to Play

- Launch the game
- Player 1 controls the left paddle using the arrow keys: up arrow to move up and down arrow to move down.
- Player 2 controls the right paddle using the W/S keys: W key to move up and S key to move down.
- The game starts with the ball in the center, and players attempt to hit the ball with their paddles to score points.
- The ball's direction changes when it collides with the paddles, and it bounces off the top and bottom edges of the screen.
- Each time a player fails to hit the ball, their opponent scores a point.
- The game continues until one player reaches the winning score.
- At the end of the game, a "Game Over" message is displayed, and players have the option to restart the game for a new match.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (included in the Python standard library)

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository or download the source code files.
- Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to start the game:
```python main.p```

## Acknowledgments

This Pong game was developed using Python classes and the Turtle module, inspired by the classic arcade game. Special thanks to the 
Python community and the creators of the Turtle module for providing a powerful and user-friendly framework for game development.
